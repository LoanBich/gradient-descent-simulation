# Gradient Descent Simulation

This is a Streamlit application that simulates the process of Gradient Descent to minimize the function `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2`. The user can adjust parameters such as learning rate, maximum iterations, and the starting point to visualize how the algorithm converges to the minimum point.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Allows the user to adjust parameters such as learning rate, maximum iterations, and starting point for the Gradient Descent.
- **Loss Curve**: Displays a 2D line plot showing the loss values at each iteration.
- **3D Surface Plot**: Visualizes the surface of the function `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2` and the trajectory of the Gradient Descent steps.

## Demo
